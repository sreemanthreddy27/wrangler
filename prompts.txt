AI Prompts Used During Development

1. Grammar Implementation
- Prompt: "Check and update grammar file for BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION tokens"
- Purpose: To verify and enhance the grammar definitions for byte size and time duration parsing
- Result: Confirmed proper implementation of token definitions in Directives.g4

2. Lexer Test Implementation
- Prompt: "Create DirectivesLexerTest for testing byte size and time duration tokens"
- Purpose: To implement comprehensive tests for token parsing
- Result: Created test cases for valid and invalid formats of both token types

3. Documentation Updates
- Prompt: "Update README.md with unit parser documentation"
- Purpose: To provide clear documentation about the new unit parsers
- Result: Added detailed sections about byte size and time duration parsers with examples

4. Integration Testing
- Prompt: "Verify AggregateStats directive with new token types"
- Purpose: To ensure proper integration of new tokens with existing functionality
- Result: Confirmed working implementation through test cases

5. Code Review
- Prompt: "Review implementation for coding standards and error handling"
- Purpose: To verify code quality and robustness
- Result: Confirmed proper implementation of error handling and adherence to coding standards
